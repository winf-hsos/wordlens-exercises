## Exercise 1: Determine dimensions

Determine the number of columns and rows of the data set. You will find that there are several ways to do this. Also, find a way to store both sizes on one variable each. This can be important, for example, if you want to work with the sizes in the further course of the script.

## Exercise 2: Useful exploration functions

Research and test the following functions. Write down in your own words what each function returns:

-   `head()`
-   `tail()`
-   `print()`
-   `sample_n()`
-   `glimpse()`
-   `summary()`
-   `colnames()`

What parameters can you pass to each function? What would you use the functions for?

## Exercise 3: Determine data types

Find a way to output the data type for each column on the console!

-  Which data types are represented?

-  In your view, have all columns been recognized correctly?

## Exercise 4: The `{skimr}` package

Install the `{skimr}` package by executing the following line:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("skimr")
```

Now consider the function `skim()`.

-  What does the function determine when we pass it a data set?

-  Use the function to output only the percentage of missing values (`NA`) for each column on the console!
